Check the prototype here :

Anyway basically
A passcode to open the door
With simple flowchart
First, we check the ultrasonic if the distance more than 10 cm
If yes, return nothing
If no, there will be a lcd saying enter your password
If correct, the servo(door in this case) will rotate(open)
The door will close itself when the ultrasonic detect that the distance is more than 10 cm
